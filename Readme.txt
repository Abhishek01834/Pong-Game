This project is a simple Pong game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file sets up the game's structure, including paddles, a ball, and score displays. CSS styles the game elements and provides layout.

In the JavaScript file, the game logic handles keyboard input for paddle control, updates the ball and paddles' positions, keeps track of scores, and checks for game over conditions.

The game starts when the Enter key is pressed, with the left paddle controlled by 'w' and 's' keys and the right paddle moving automatically. Points are scored when the ball passes the opponent's paddle, and the game ends when one player reaches the winning score.

This project is a great way to learn game development and web development fundamentals.
